### Business Results/Findings
The analysis results are summariesd as follows:
1. Out of the eight stores owned by A2Z Business LTD, four store were able to impressively exceed their targets for the year with the LEE-MYERS store making the most variance of 31.1% increase, which is the difference between the total revenue and total target. Their best revenue generated was in the first and third quarters, with Sundays, Saturdays and Wednesdays the most profitable business days.
2. Other store like Lopez, Barron Fleming, and Myer Lopez store exceeded their targets with 30%, 29.5% and 26.7% respectively
3. Base on this analysis, the manager was able to notice the Novak Store and other stores that did poorly. Novak store never met their monthly target for the whole year, with difference of -24.6%.
4. Their are a few outliers in the dataset which resulted to increase in average revenue
5. There is a possitive cofrrelation between revenue and total budget

### REcommendations
Based on the analysis carried out, i recommend the following actions:
- A2Z Business should implement the strenth of LEE MyER store and other thrieving stores, in other stores that are struggling.
- Strategic marketing campaign should be done based on statistics and not assumptions for better store performance.
- Invest more in marketing and promoting products during peak Sales seasons to maximize sales for those stores doing poorly.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in LEE-MYERS, LOPEX, BARRON FLEMING, and MYER LOPEZ stores
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high value customers in each store. 

### Limitations
- I removed all rows with null values in the target column because they would affect the accuracy of my analysis
- During data cleaning, i noticed that there is no data entry uniformism in all stores.
- There a few outliers
